### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with more than 10 years of experience. I am specializing in Web Development and currently learning about Data Engineering.

You can find all about me, my experience and what I'm working on in my blog [andnik.com](https://andnik.com)

I have been working on some of my open source respositories and I encourage you to join me:
* [Algorithms](https://github.com/anikolaienko/Algorithms) - solutions to some of the coding interview tasks and algorithms that I find interesting.
* [py-automapper](https://github.com/anikolaienko/py-automapper) - Object to object mapping tool for Python with extendability that I didn't find in other mappers.
